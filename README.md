# Next.js + Three.js Starter Template

This repo is a personal boilerplate for creative coding projects using **Next.js (with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS)** and **Three.js**. It’s perfect for quickly launching experiments with 3D graphics in a modern React workflow.

## Features

- Next.js setup with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Three.js pre-installed and ready to use in React components
- Example starter code: minimal Three.js scene (rotating cube)
- Works out of the box with hot reload for easy development

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone this Template

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nextjs-threejs-starter.git my-new-creative-project
cd my-new-creative-project

text

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `my-new-creative-project` with your actual GitHub username and desired folder name.

### 2. Install Dependencies

npm install

or
yarn

text

### 3. Run the Development Server

npm run dev

or
yarn dev

text

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your project in the browser.

## Usage

- Start building your 3D scene in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- The starter comes with a rotating cube example. Replace it with your creative ideas!
- To create a new project using this starter in the future, clone this repo again and repeat these steps.

## Tips for Your Projects

- Rename the project folder after cloning if you want to organize your experiments.
- You can remove the original git history for new projects:

rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for my new creative project"

text

- Keep adding reusable utility code or patterns to this starter as you learn more!

## Why This Template?

- Skip repetitive setup every time you want to try a new creative coding idea.
- Keep TypeScript, Tailwind, and Three.js always configured.
- No more hassle with weird server/client issues in Next.js + Three.js—just start making.

**Happy creative coding!**
